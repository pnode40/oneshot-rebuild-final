# Migration System Rebuild: Milestones

## Completed Milestones

### Phase 0: Investigation and Diagnosis
- [x] Identified the "undefined.sql" error in standard Drizzle migrate function
- [x] Updated Drizzle ORM to latest version (0.43.1) to check if issue was fixed
- [x] Diagnosed type mismatch in migration tracking table (BIGINT column with string values)
- [x] Created diagnostic tools to analyze the database state
- [x] Verified that hybrid approach works as temporary workaround

### Phase 1: Solution Design
- [x] Researched possible approaches to fix the issue
- [x] Conducted risk assessment of different solutions
- [x] Designed comprehensive rebuild strategy
- [x] Created detailed implementation plan
- [x] Prepared project management documents

## Current Progress

We have completed the investigation and solution design phases. We have determined that a complete rebuild of the migration system is the most sustainable approach, with a risk-managed implementation plan.

## Upcoming Tasks

### Phase 2: Migration System Rebuild (Next Steps)
- [ ] Implement rebuild-migration-state.ts script
- [ ] Create migration validation tool
- [ ] Test rebuilt system with existing migrations
- [ ] Update documentation for the new approach

### Phase 3: Enhanced Testing and Reliability
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for migrations
- [ ] Implement automatic rollback on failure
- [ ] Add cross-environment validation
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

### Phase 4: Developer Experience Improvements
- [ ] Create custom migration CLI tool
- [ ] Add visualization and progress tracking
- [ ] Improve error messages and diagnostics
- [ ] Document the new workflow for developers

### Phase 5: Community Contribution
- [ ] Create minimal reproduction case for Drizzle ORM issue
- [ ] Identify fix in Drizzle source code
- [ ] Submit pull request to Drizzle ORM repository
- [ ] Add tests to ensure the fix is comprehensive

## Timeline

- **Phase 2**: 1 week
- **Phase 3**: 1 week
- **Phase 4**: 3-5 days
- **Phase 5**: Ongoing (dependent on community interaction)

## Priority Order

1. Implement rebuild-migration-state.ts script (critical)
2. Test and validate the rebuilt system (critical)
3. Add enhanced testing and rollback capabilities (high)
4. Improve developer experience (medium)
5. Contribute fix to Drizzle community (optional but valuable)
