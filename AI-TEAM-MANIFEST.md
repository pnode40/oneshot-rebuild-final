- Environment variables and secrets
- Deployment targets
- Performance metrics

**Key Deliverables**:
1. One-command startup scripts that work on any platform
2. Automated deployment pipelines
3. Health check endpoints
4. Environment configuration management
5. Disaster recovery procedures

## Interaction Protocol

### 1. Feature Development Flow
```
Eric (defines feature) 
  ‚Üí ChatGPT (creates tasks)
    ‚Üí Gemini (reviews architecture)
      ‚Üí Claude (implements)
        ‚Üí Operator (ensures it runs)
          ‚Üí Eric (verifies)
```

### 2. Bug Fix Flow
```
Eric (reports issue)
  ‚Üí Claude (diagnoses)
    ‚Üí Operator (checks infrastructure)
      ‚Üí Claude (implements fix)
        ‚Üí Eric (verifies)
```

### 3. Infrastructure Issue Flow
```
Eric (reports environment issue)
  ‚Üí Operator (diagnoses)
    ‚Üí Operator (implements fix)
      ‚Üí Claude (updates code if needed)
        ‚Üí Eric (verifies)
```

## Context Preservation Protocol

Each AI session MUST:
1. Start with role activation and context
2. Review recent changes/issues
3. Understand current environment state
4. Document decisions made
5. Create handoff notes for next session

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Assume bash/Unix when user is on Windows
- Create circular npm scripts
- Hardcode environment-specific paths
- Skip error handling
- Forget cross-platform compatibility

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Ask about target platform first
- Use platform-agnostic approaches
- Document all assumptions
- Test commands before suggesting
- Provide fallback options

## Success Metrics

1. **Zero "It works on my machine" issues**
2. **One-command startup always works**
3. **New developers productive in < 30 minutes**
4. **Deployment takes < 5 minutes**
5. **No manual environment configuration**

## The Golden Rule

> "If Eric has to debug it, we've failed."

Every piece of infrastructure must be:
- Self-documenting
- Self-healing
- Self-explanatory
- Idiot-proof

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Operator role immediately
2. Create comprehensive environment setup automation
3. Document all infrastructure decisions
4. Build deployment pipeline
5. Establish monitoring/alerting

Remember: **Excellence in infrastructure enables excellence in development.**
