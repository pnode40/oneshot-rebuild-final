# OneShot Public Profile Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the must-have features and technical specifications for the public-facing athlete profile pages on the OneShot recruiting platform. The public profile is the core component viewed by college recruiters when evaluating athletes.

## Design Philosophy
- **Mobile-first approach**: Optimize for mobile viewing as recruiters often evaluate on-the-go
- **5-second scan strategy**: Key metrics must be visible immediately (Height, Weight, GPA)
- **Card-style premium design**: Clean layout with OneShot branding (subtle blue, premium aesthetic)
- **No CTAs or inline buttons**: Focus on presenting information, not actions

## URL Structure
- Slug-based URLs: `oneshot.xyz/u/{custom-slug}`
- Real-time slug availability checking during profile creation
- Shareable, memorable URLs for athletes to distribute to recruiters

## Core Profile Components

### Above-the-Fold Content (Mobile Priority)
The following must be visible without scrolling on mobile devices:

| Component | Details | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Profile Photo | Banner-style presentation | Required |
| Name | First name + Last name + Jersey Number | Full visibility |
| School Info | High school + Graduation year | Always visible |
| Position(s) | Primary and secondary positions | Always visible |
| Key Metrics | Height, Weight, GPA | If made visible by athlete |
| Verification | Transcript badge (if uploaded) | Visual indicator only |
| NCAA Info | ID + Eligibility status | Only for Transfer Portal athletes |

### Video Highlights Section
- YouTube embed (plays inline) or Hudl redirect with thumbnail preview
- One featured video prominently displayed
- Clear playback behavior indicators

### Coach Contact Information
- Coach's First/Last Name
- Email and Phone number
- Visual verification status indicator
- Protected from scraping/automated collection

## Technical Requirements
