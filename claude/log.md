# OneShot Development Log

## April 30, 2025

### Session Summary
Created foundational database schema for the OneShot recruiting platform, focusing on the users table and authentication system.

### Technical Tasks Completed
- Created the users table schema with proper fields for authentication
- Set up role-based access control with a PostgreSQL enum type
- Configured the database connection to Neon PostgreSQL
- Created indexes for performance optimization
- Applied the schema to the production database

### Implementation Details
- Implemented a comprehensive user model with email/password authentication
- Added role-based permissions (athlete, recruiter, admin, parent)
- Created verification flow fields (isVerified, emailVerificationToken)
- Added profile fields (firstName, lastName, profilePicture, bio)

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- Initial migration failed due to existing profiles table
- Created a custom SQL script with IF NOT EXISTS safeguards
- Applied the script directly using a Node.js PostgreSQL client

### Next Steps
- Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, verify email)
- Create middleware for protecting routes with role-based permissions
- Build user profile management API

## May 1, 2025

### Session Summary
Implemented a complete JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control for the OneShot platform.

### Technical Tasks Completed
- Created authentication endpoints for user registration and login
- Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Developed JWT token generation and verification
- Built middleware for authenticating protected routes
- Implemented role-based authorization middleware
- Created test routes to verify different permission levels
- Added comprehensive testing script to validate the authentication flow

### Implementation Details
- User registration with email/password verification
- Secure password storage using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- JWT tokens with user ID, email, and role information
- Role-based middleware that restricts routes based on user role
- Test user creation script for development/testing purposes

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- Initial server connectivity issues during testing
- Created diagnostic scripts to validate server endpoints
- Improved error handling in test scripts to provide better debugging information
- Separated route testing to continue despite partial failures

### Next Steps
- Connect the authentication system to the front-end UI
- Implement email verification flow
- Add password reset functionality
- Build user profile management CRUD operations

## May 5, 2025

### Session Summary
Completed frontend-backend integration and implemented core athlete profile creation flow.

### Technical Tasks Completed
- Built frontend JWT authentication system with AuthContext
- Implemented protected routes using react-router-dom
- Created athlete profile creation form with validation
- Fixed migration system issues with Neon DB
- Enforced user-profile relationship via DB foreign key
- Performed extensive code cleanup and quality improvements

### Implementation Details
- Global auth state management via React context
- Tailwind CSS mobile-first layout for forms
- Full Zod validation with inline error states
- JWT-authenticated form submission
- Form state management (loading, errors, success)
- Migration utility scripts:
  - mark-migrations-applied.js
  - clean-migration-tracking.js
  - add-migration.ts

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- User role enum conflict in Neon DB resolved
- Cleaned and synced migration history
- Fixed Fast Refresh issues
- Standardized environment fallback options

### Current Platform State
- Athletes can now register → log in → submit profiles securely
- Data is scoped by user identity
- Backend and frontend are tightly integrated and production-ready for core MVP flow

## May 6, 2025

### Session Summary
Defined and planned the May 21st MVP deliverables, focusing on an enhanced athlete profile system with public visibility controls.

### Technical Tasks Completed
- Analyzed the May 21st MVP requirements document
- Created a comprehensive task breakdown and implementation plan
- Updated project documentation with the new MVP scope
- Prioritized features into CORE and STRETCH categories
- Established a development sequence for optimal progress

### Implementation Details
- Defined extended database schema requirements for profiles:
  - Basic fields (jersey number, high school, graduation year, etc.)
  - Media fields (profile photo, transcript, highlight video)
  - Visibility flags for privacy control
  - Custom URL slug for public profiles
- Outlined API endpoints needed for the MVP:
  - Enhanced profile creation/update
  - Public profile viewing with visibility rules
  - File upload handling
- Planned frontend components:
  - Enhanced profile form with all required fields
  - Public profile view with proper layout
  - Media upload and embedding components

### May 21st MVP Core Focus
1. Database Schema Extensions
2. Media Storage Setup
3. API Endpoint Development
4. Internal Profile UI
5. Public Profile UI
6. Testing and Refinement

### Next Steps
- Begin database schema extensions
- Set up media storage infrastructure
- Implement enhanced profile API endpoints

## May 7, 2025

### Session Summary
Extended the profiles table with all fields required for the May 21st MVP, including visibility controls and media URLs.

### Technical Tasks Completed
- Created a comprehensive migration (0005_extend_profiles_table.sql) to add all required fields
- Updated the Drizzle ORM schema in schema.ts to reflect the new fields
- Applied the migration to the database and verified all columns were added
- Added proper constraints and default values for all fields
- Created an enum type for athlete_role ('high_school', 'transfer_portal')

### Implementation Details
- Added basic information fields:
  - jersey_number, athlete_role, custom_url_slug, high_school_name
  - graduation_year (as integer), gpa (as decimal)
- Added media URL fields:
  - profile_photo_url, transcript_url, highlight_video_url
- Added NCAA/Transfer Portal specific fields:
  - ncaa_id, eligibility_years_remaining, transfer_portal_entry_date
- Added visibility control flags:
  - is_height_visible, is_weight_visible, is_gpa_visible
  - is_transcript_visible, is_ncaa_info_visible
- Added uniqueness constraint on custom_url_slug
- Created index on custom_url_slug for faster lookups

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- Migration system issues with "undefined.sql" error
- Used a custom Node.js script to directly execute the SQL
- Marked the migration as applied in the Drizzle migration tracking table
- Verified schema changes by querying the database information schema

### Next Steps
- Set up media storage infrastructure for profile photos and transcripts
- Implement enhanced profile API endpoints for creating/updating profiles with the new fields
- Create a public profile endpoint that respects visibility settings

- Created upload directories with appropriate structure
- Implemented file type validation for security
- Built API endpoints for file uploads with authentication
- Created utilities for file URL generation and management
- Developed a test interface for verifying upload functionality

### Implementation Details
- Created a robust file upload utility with:
  - Secure filename generation with user ID and timestamps
  - File type validation (images for photos, PDF for transcripts)
  - File size limits (5MB per file)
  - Organized directory structure
- Implemented dedicated API endpoints:
  - `/api/upload/profile-photo` for profile photos
  - `/api/upload/transcript` for transcript PDFs
  - `/api/upload/profile-media` for combined uploads

- Implemented proper error handling for upload failures

### Next Steps
- Enhance profile API endpoints to handle the new fields and file uploads
- Create a public profile endpoint that respects visibility settings
- Build the enhanced profile form UI with file upload components
