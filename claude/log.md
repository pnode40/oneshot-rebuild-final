# OneShot Development Log

## May 25, 2024

### Session Summary
Created foundational database schema for the OneShot recruiting platform, focusing on the users table and authentication system.

### Technical Tasks Completed
- Created the users table schema with proper fields for authentication
- Set up role-based access control with a PostgreSQL enum type
- Configured the database connection to Neon PostgreSQL
- Created indexes for performance optimization
- Applied the schema to the production database

### Implementation Details
- Implemented a comprehensive user model with email/password authentication
- Added role-based permissions (athlete, recruiter, admin, parent)
- Created verification flow fields (isVerified, emailVerificationToken)
- Added profile fields (firstName, lastName, profilePicture, bio)

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
- Initial migration failed due to existing profiles table
- Created a custom SQL script with IF NOT EXISTS safeguards
- Applied the script directly using a Node.js PostgreSQL client

### Next Steps
- Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, verify email)
- Create middleware for protecting routes with role-based permissions
- Build user profile management API
