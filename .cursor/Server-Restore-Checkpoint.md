# 📌 Server-Restore-Checkpoint.md

## 🧠 Purpose
This document captures the structured rollback, self-audit, and recovery process following Claude’s failed attempt to refactor the OneShot server architecture. It must be referenced by Claude before making any future structural changes to the server.

---

## 🔙 Original Refactor Summary (Claude's Initial Goal)
Claude refactored the server to:
- Centralize environment configuration (via `config/index.ts`)
- Improve TypeScript clarity (via updated `tsconfig.json` and path aliases)
- Standardize server startup scripts from the project root
- Simplify code structure by reducing index.ts dependencies

**Intended Outcome:** A cleaner, more robust, maintainable backend.

---

## ❌ What Went Wrong (Startup Failures)
Despite best intentions, the refactor caused:
- CWD conflicts when running `npm run dev` from the root
- Module resolution errors (e.g., `Cannot find module 'src/db/client'`)
- Broken TypeScript imports due to mismatched `baseUrl` and runtime paths
- Confusing architecture that blocked all Phase 1 API endpoint testing
- Needlessly complex config that introduced circular dependencies

---

## ✅ Claude's Self-Audit Summary (Key Lessons Learned)
Claude later performed a structured reflection and concluded:
- The attempt to unify config introduced unnecessary complexity
- CWD behavior in Node.js and scripts was misunderstood
- `baseUrl` and `paths` in `tsconfig` don’t affect runtime
- Simplicity and consistency in file structure and import patterns are more important than abstract modularity

---

## ✅ Gemini's Review
Gemini reviewed Claude’s audit and:
- Fully endorsed Claude’s “New Server Plan”
- Recommended keeping Claude’s simplified plan but reintroducing Zod-based `.env` validation later
- Agreed the prior refactor failed and supported rollback

---

## 🔁 Eric’s Decision: Roll Back + Rebuild
Eric decided to:
- **Restore the server codebase to a known-good checkpoint** before Claude’s architectural changes
- Task Claude with reimplementing the server using its **New Server Plan**, now informed by failure

This plan includes:
- Running the server as an isolated unit from `server/`
- Using `cd server && npm run dev`
- Removing complex `baseUrl`, aliasing, or nested config
- Simplifying imports and startup logic

---

## ⚠️ Boot Protocol for Claude (Mandatory)
Before making any structural or architectural changes to the server, Claude must:
1. Load and review `Server-Restore-Checkpoint.md`
2. Cross-check current assumptions with the failures listed above
3. Apply the principles of the “New Server Plan” ONLY

This checkpoint is part of the OneShot memory OS.
Do not repeat structural mistakes that have already been resolved.
