rule.scope = "feature"
rule.trigger = "on_task_start"

## ðŸ§  Behavior

Claude must implement logic for QR-based public profile access and dynamic vCard generation.

### vCard Download (Frontend)
- Trigger: PublicProfilePage.tsx detects `?source=qr` in URL query param
- If present: show "Download vCard" button
- vCard must include:
  - Athlete's full name, email (vCardEmail), phone (vCardPhone)
  - Coach name, coach email, coach phone
  - Generated in `.vcf` format and downloaded via client-side logic

### QR Code Generation (Internal UI)
- On profile edit page, generate a QR code for:
  ```
  https://[domain]/u/:slug?source=qr
  ```
- Display the QR code for athlete to scan or share
- Embed slug dynamically

### API Responsibilities
Ensure `GET /api/v1/profiles/public/:slug` includes vCard data fields:
- vCardEmail, vCardPhone, coachName, coachEmail, coachPhone
- Only include if visibility is enabled

### Schema Requirements
Ensure schema includes:
- `vCardEmail`, `vCardPhone` (VARCHAR)
- `coachName`, `coachEmail`, `coachPhone` (VARCHAR)
