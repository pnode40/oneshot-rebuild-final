## ðŸ§  Behavior

Claude must implement all backend and frontend functionality related to core media features for MVP.

### Profile Photo (Required)
- Frontend: Upload field in internal profile form
- Accept 1 image (JPEG or PNG), validate dimensions (min 1200x630)
- Backend: Store in media directory or S3 bucket and persist reference in database
- Public View: Display as banner on /profile/:slug

### Highlight Video
- Frontend: Text input field for YouTube or Hudl URL
- Allow entry of both, but only one shown as "featured"
- Add logic for athlete to pick which to display first
- Include modal with guidance:
  - YouTube: embeds on page
  - Hudl: opens in new tab

### Data Schema
Ensure `profilePhotoUrl`, `highlightVideoUrl`, and `highlightVideoType` fields are included in schema and properly persisted via backend API.

### API Responsibilities
- Accept, validate, and save profile photo uploads
- Ensure highlight video links are validated and stored
- On GET /api/v1/profiles/public/:slug:

  - Only return if visibility is enabled

## ðŸ§ª Manual Verification (Eric)
