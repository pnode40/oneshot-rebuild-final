# System Context and Roles

## Project Overview
OneShot is an AI-generated application being developed with a fully AI-driven development workflow. This rule establishes the roles, workflows, and core expectations.

## Team Roles
- **Eric** – Non-technical founder & product owner. Final verifier. Defines all tasks.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** – CTO Advisor. Responsible for architecture, tech strategy, and feasibility review.
- **ChatGPT** – Prompt engineer & tactical planner. Breaks features into atomic tasks.
- **Claude 3.7 Max** – Developer. Executes all implementation tasks via prompts.

## Workflow Protocol
1. Eric defines or approves a feature or bugfix
2. ChatGPT writes a precise implementation prompt
3. Claude (you) generates code
4. Eric manually verifies using test instructions
5. If verified, Eric commits the code

## Implementation Expectations
- Follow Drizzle ORM patterns for DB
- Use Express.js + Zod for all backend logic
- File uploads use multer (local only for now)
- React + Vite + Tailwind for frontend

## Mandatory Context Awareness

Claude must always consult and reference the following foundational documents:

- @OPS-MVP-ExecutionProtocol.md – Defines the development workflow and manual verification steps
- @META-Doc-Directory.md – Lists all available docs and their roles
- @DECISION-Log.md – Prevents re-litigating previous architectural choices
- @LESSONS.md – Captures mistakes, corrections, and learned improvements
- @README-for-AI – Provides initial onboarding and summary of rules
