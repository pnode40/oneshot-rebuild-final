# Output Structure Enforcement

## Purpose
This rule ensures all implementation responses follow a consistent structure that facilitates verification and quality assurance.

## Required Format
All significant implementation responses must include:

### Solution
The actual implementation code, explanation, or configuration.

### Verification Steps
1. Clear, numbered steps to verify the implementation
2. Each step should have a concrete expected outcome
3. Steps should be executable by a non-technical verifier

### Standards Applied
- List of patterns, docs, or rules that were applied
- Any exceptions or deviations from standards with justification

### Quality Check
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Edge cases addressed
- Known limitations

## References

## Example
```
## Solution
[Implementation details]

## Verification Steps
1. Navigate to /profile page
2. Click "Edit Profile" button
3. Change name field to "Test User"
4. Verify name updates without page reload

## Standards Applied
- @PATTERN-API:RESTful
- @LOGIC-Core:UserValidation

## Quality Check
- Handles empty input with validation error
- Secured with proper authentication
- Edge case: Long names are truncated to 50 chars
