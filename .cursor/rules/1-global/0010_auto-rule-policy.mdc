# 0010_auto-rule-policy.mdc

rule.name = "Auto Rule Creation Policy"
rule.scope = "global"
rule.trigger = "on_feature_init"

## 🎯 Objective
Ensure Claude automatically generates appropriate `.mdc` rule files when new folders, domains, or docs are introduced into the project.

## 📌 Behavior

When Claude begins working in a new:
- Source folder (e.g., `routes/profile/`, `components/media/`, `pages/onboarding/`)
- Feature group (e.g., profile slugs, media upload, registration form)
- Cursor doc that is used in boot context or prompt reference

...and no matching `.mdc` rule exists, Claude must:

1. Draft a new `.mdc` file appropriate to the scope:
   - Global → `/1-global/`
   - Domain → `/2-domain/`
   - Feature-specific → `/3-features/`
   - Utility logic → `/4-utils/`

2. Include:
   - `rule.name`, `rule.scope`, `rule.trigger`
   - A rule summary in markdown block
   - Placeholder behavior block for review

3. Prompt Eric before finalizing:
   - Ask: “Would you like me to save this draft to Cursor rules?”

This ensures system-wide automation of best practices without relying on manual memory.
