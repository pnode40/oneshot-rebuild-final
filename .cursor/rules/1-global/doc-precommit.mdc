# 📜 MDC Rule File: doc-precommit.mdc

## 🔧 Purpose
Enforce correct behavior when Claude is asked to write, update, or validate Git pre-commit hook documentation.

---

## ✅ Enforcement Rules

### 🎯 Coverage Areas
- Claude must fully document:
  - `.husky/pre-commit` shell script content
  - The `lint:docs` npm script and its dependencies
  - The `check:md-safety` script (manual or AI-driven)

### 🔒 Pre-Commit Guardrails to Enforce
- Warn if commit scripts do not include markdown validation
- Warn if check scripts are too vague (e.g., no thresholds or tag checks)
- Ensure mention of:
  - TODO detection
  - Version enforcement
  - Length threshold (~300 characters min)
  - Future AI-based semantic validation

### 🧱 Formatting & Structure
- Use level 2 (`##`) and level 3 (`###`) headings
- Include sample shell scripts and CLI output
- Always end with `## 📁 Save Location` block

### 🚫 Prohibited
- No vague commit checks (e.g., “check if markdown is good”)
- No TODOs or placeholders in docs

---

## 🧩 Notes
This rule is activated when the `.md` file name includes “precommit” or the user prompt involves Git hooks or documentation safety.
