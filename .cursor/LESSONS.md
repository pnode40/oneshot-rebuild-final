## Example: Standardized API Error Handling

**Date:** 2025-05-08  
**Category:** Code  
**Issue:** Inconsistent error handling across API endpoints led to unpredictable client behavior  
**Solution:** Implemented global error middleware with standardized error format  
**Pattern to Follow:** Use centralized error handling middleware and consistent error response structure  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Handling errors differently across endpoints or returning raw error messages  
**Impact:** Frontend can reliably parse error responses; improved debugging and user experience  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, in api-standards.mdc under Error Handling section

## Recent Lessons

## Lesson: Cursor Rules Implementation Strategy

**Date:** 2025-05-09  
**Category:** Process  
**Issue:** Implementing a comprehensive rules system while ensuring proper integration with existing documentation and avoiding overwhelming context  

**Solution:** Created a hierarchical rule structure with layered application (global, domain, utility) and careful metadata management

**Pattern to Follow:** - Start with minimal global rules (3-5 core principles)
- Use glob patterns to target specific file contexts
- Create self-documenting rule files with examples
- Implement progressive loading via references rather than content duplication

**Pattern to Avoid:** - Creating overlapping rules that might conflict
- Making rules too verbose (caused PowerShell script issues)
- Placing too much logic in always-apply rules (context efficiency)
- Relying on exact paths in glob patterns (fragile)

**Impact:** - Rules now provide consistent guidance with minimal context overhead
- Verification steps are standardized across all implementations
- Documentation is connected to enforcement mechanisms
- System scales with project growth through modular design

**Added to Rules:** Yes, principles have been embedded in rule structure itself

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. Create a simple rule validator script to check formatting
2. Document rule precedence explicitly for future reference
3. Consider implementing a visualization of which rules apply to which files
4. Create a mechanism to track which rules are most frequently triggered
