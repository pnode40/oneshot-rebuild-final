## Example: Standardized API Error Handling

**Date:** 2025-05-08  
**Category:** Code  
**Issue:** Inconsistent error handling across API endpoints led to unpredictable client behavior  
**Solution:** Implemented global error middleware with standardized error format  
**Pattern to Follow:** Use centralized error handling middleware and consistent error response structure  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Handling errors differently across endpoints or returning raw error messages  
**Impact:** Frontend can reliably parse error responses; improved debugging and user experience  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, in api-standards.mdc under Error Handling section

## Recent Lessons

## Lesson: Mandatory Documentation for Context Preservation

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Category:** Process  
**Issue:** Complete failure to maintain documentation during development session led to context loss risk  
**Solution:** Created mandatory documentation rule (004-mandatory-documentation.md) with enforced checklist  
**Pattern to Follow:** Document decisions, features, and insights in real-time during development, not at session end  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Assuming documentation can be done "later" or that context will be remembered  
**Impact:** Prevents catastrophic context loss between sessions, maintains project continuity, enables effective AI team collaboration  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, 1-global/004-mandatory-documentation.md

## Lesson: Psychology-Driven UX Design for Recruiting

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Category:** Architecture  
**Issue:** Initial profile designs focused on comprehensive data display rather than recruiter decision-making psychology  
**Solution:** Implemented "Traffic Light" design with 5-second qualification focus in hero section  
**Pattern to Follow:** Design for user mental models and time constraints, not just data completeness  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Treating recruiting profiles like social media profiles or comprehensive portfolios  
**Impact:** Creates competitive advantage by optimizing for actual recruiter behavior vs. assumptions  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, embedded in DECISION-Log.md and FEATURE-EnhancedProfileSystem.md

## Lesson: Trust Verification as Competitive Differentiation

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Category:** Architecture  
**Issue:** GPA verification typically requires disruptive transcript downloads that break recruiter evaluation flow  
**Solution:** Quick-view iframe modal for 2-3 second verification without downloads  
**Pattern to Follow:** Solve friction points that competitors accept as "normal" to create differentiation  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Copying existing platform patterns without understanding their limitations  
**Impact:** Maintains recruiter evaluation momentum while building trust - unique competitive advantage  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, documented in DECISION-Log.md

## Lesson: Cost Optimization Through Strategic Task Delegation

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Category:** Process  
**Issue:** Using Claude 4 Max for all tasks regardless of complexity creates unnecessary costs  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive SOP for task classification and delegation to simpler models  
**Pattern to Follow:** Classify tasks by complexity and strategic value before execution  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Default to high-cost models for routine or templated work  
**Impact:** 40-60% cost reduction potential while maintaining quality on high-leverage work  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, SOP-CostOptimization.md created

## Lesson: Mobile-First QR Code UX for Critical Moments

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Category:** Architecture  
**Issue:** Traditional contact exchange at camps/events is awkward and unprofessional  
**Solution:** Giant QR code with instant access + vCard generation for professional networking  
**Pattern to Follow:** Design for high-stress, time-sensitive scenarios where users might be nervous  
**Pattern to Avoid:** Assuming users have time to navigate complex interfaces in critical moments  
**Impact:** Transforms awkward social media exchanges into professional networking interactions  
**Added to Rules:** Yes, documented in DECISION-Log.md and FEATURE-EnhancedProfileSystem.md

## Lesson: Cursor Rules Implementation Strategy

**Date:** 2025-05-09  
**Category:** Process  
**Issue:** Implementing a comprehensive rules system while ensuring proper integration with existing documentation and avoiding overwhelming context  

**Solution:** Created a hierarchical rule structure with layered application (global, domain, utility) and careful metadata management

**Pattern to Follow:** - Start with minimal global rules (3-5 core principles)
- Use glob patterns to target specific file contexts
- Create self-documenting rule files with examples
- Implement progressive loading via references rather than content duplication

**Pattern to Avoid:** - Creating overlapping rules that might conflict
- Making rules too verbose (caused PowerShell script issues)
- Placing too much logic in always-apply rules (context efficiency)
- Relying on exact paths in glob patterns (fragile)

**Impact:** - Rules now provide consistent guidance with minimal context overhead
- Verification steps are standardized across all implementations
- Documentation is connected to enforcement mechanisms
- System scales with project growth through modular design

**Added to Rules:** Yes, principles have been embedded in rule structure itself

**Suggested Improvements:**
1. Create a simple rule validator script to check formatting
2. Document rule precedence explicitly for future reference
3. Consider implementing a visualization of which rules apply to which files
4. Create a mechanism to track which rules are most frequently triggered
