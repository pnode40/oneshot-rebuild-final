This document captures the key architectural decisions made during the backend server restoration and stabilization effort (May 2025). It supports traceability, context, and rationale for the new baseline implementation.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Key Decisions

| Area                        | Decision                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server Structure            | Follow "New Server Plan": Linear index.ts, no global config, per-module dotenv |
| Module Resolution           | Use only relative import paths (no path aliases)                         |
| Environment Variable Loading| Centralize dotenv.config() in index.ts; remove from client.ts            |
| Drizzle ORM Setup           | Standard Drizzle schema + generate/migrate scripts; deprecated custom flows |
| Migrations                  | Rebuild from scratch; commit only aligned, verified migrations           |
| Verification                | Use console-based runtime checks (env var + DB query) as manual verification |
| Directory Cleanup           | Remove legacy test scripts, migrations, and nested configs               |

## üìå Permanent Changes

- **.env loading** is now centralized and must only occur at the top of `server/src/index.ts`.
- The project no longer supports global path aliases. All files must use relative paths like `../utils/log.ts`.
- `server/uploads/` is ignored via `.gitignore` and must never be committed.
- `server/public/upload-test.html` is included for smoke testing only.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Considerations

| Topic                  | Recommendation                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drizzle Kit CLI        | Migrate all custom scripts (migrate.ts, validate-migrations) to standard Drizzle CLI usage |
| Auth Strategy          | Ensure Passport.js strategy config is modular and loaded after dotenv |
| Error Handling         | Consider elevating error utils to a reusable `server/src/utils/` pattern |
| CI/CD Integration      | Add .env schema validation during build step (Zod-based)    |
| Config Consistency     | All config files should follow `server/` as canonical location |
