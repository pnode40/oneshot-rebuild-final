# SOP-CostOptimization.md ‚Äî AI Task Delegation Strategy

## Purpose
This SOP defines how to optimize AI development costs by strategically delegating tasks between Claude 4 Max (high-cost) and simpler models (low-cost) based on complexity and value.

---

## Task Classification Framework

### üî• **HIGH-LEVERAGE (Claude 4 Max)**
**Criteria:** Requires advanced reasoning, system understanding, or critical decision-making

**Task Types:**
- **Critical Code:** Core business logic, complex algorithms, security implementations
- **Advanced Architecture:** System design, database schema, API design patterns  
- **Security Logic:** Authentication, authorization, data validation, safety checks
- **Complex Bug Fixes:** Multi-system issues, performance problems, mysterious errors
- **Strategic Decisions:** Technology choices, architectural trade-offs, feature prioritization
- **Code Reviews:** Quality assessment of complex implementations

**Cost Justification:** High-complexity failures create expensive rework cycles

---

### üí∞ **LOW-LEVERAGE (Delegate to Simpler Models)**
**Criteria:** Predictable, templated, or low-risk tasks with clear specifications

**Task Types:**
- **Copywriting:** Documentation, user-facing text, error messages, help content
- **Formatting:** Code style fixes, linting, consistent indentation, comment cleanup  
- **Logging:** Adding console.log, debug statements, basic error tracking
- **Simple Tests:** Unit tests for pure functions, happy-path test cases
- **Configuration:** ENV files, basic JSON configs, package.json updates
- **Data Entry:** Seed data, mock data, sample content creation

**Delegation Strategy:** Provide exact specifications and templates

---

## Implementation Protocol

### **Before Every Task:**
1. **Classify the task** using the framework above
2. **If HIGH-LEVERAGE:** Proceed with Claude 4 Max
3. **If LOW-LEVERAGE:** Recommend delegation with this template:

```
"This task is LOW-LEVERAGE and suitable for delegation to save costs:

Task: [Brief description]
Complexity: [Low/Predictable]  
Template: [Provide exact pattern to follow]
Success Criteria: [Clear completion definition]

Estimated cost savings: [High/Medium/Low]
Risk if delegated: [Low/None]"
```

### **Quality Gates:**
- All delegated work must be reviewed by Claude 4 Max before integration
- Any delegation that creates rework defeats the cost optimization
- When in doubt, classify as HIGH-LEVERAGE

---

## Success Metrics
- **Cost Reduction:** 40-60% reduction in Claude 4 Max usage on appropriate tasks
- **Quality Maintenance:** No increase in bug rate from delegated work  
- **Velocity Improvement:** Faster completion of routine tasks
- **Focus Enhancement:** More Claude 4 Max time on high-value architecture and complex problem-solving

---

## Examples

### ‚úÖ **Successful Delegation**
- **Task:** Add console.log statements to track form submission flow
- **Why Delegated:** Templated, low-risk, clear specification
- **Template Provided:** `console.log('[COMPONENT_NAME] - [ACTION]: [DATA]')`
- **Outcome:** Completed quickly, no rework needed

### ‚ùå **Failed Delegation** 
- **Task:** Debug complex database connection issue  
- **Why Failed:** Required system knowledge and reasoning
- **Lesson:** Database issues always require Claude 4 Max analysis
