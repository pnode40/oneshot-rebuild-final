# OneShot Server Restoration - Summary of Completed Work

## Core Structural Changes

### Environment Configuration
- **Fixed environment variable loading**: Moved `dotenv.config()` to the top of `server/src/index.ts` to ensure proper loading
- **Database URL handling**: Fixed broken DATABASE_URL parsing in .env file by correcting formatting issues
- **Removed hardcoding**: Eliminated temporary DATABASE_URL hardcoding in index.ts
- **Connection verification**: Successfully established connection to Neon PostgreSQL database

### Server Architecture
- **Linear code structure**: Refactored `server/src/index.ts` to follow a clean, linear flow pattern:
  1. Environment setup (dotenv)
  2. Core imports
  3. Express app initialization
  4. Middleware setup
  5. Static file serving
  6. Route registration
  7. Global error handler
  8. Server startup
- **Added security enhancements**: Integrated Helmet middleware
- **Global error handling**: Implemented a standardized error handler
- **URL-encoded data support**: Added proper express.urlencoded middleware

### Database Schema
- **Schema alignment**: Added missing columns to match Drizzle ORM schema definitions
- **Migration management**: Created and applied migration for missing columns (slug, etc.)
- **Type safety**: Ensured proper type handling between JavaScript and PostgreSQL

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Clean tsconfig**: Standardized server/tsconfig.json without path aliases
- **Module resolution**: Set proper module resolution to "node"
- **Import path standardization**: Ensured all local imports use relative paths

## Repository Management

### Git Configuration
- **Repository hygiene**: Created and updated .gitignore files:
  - Root .gitignore for project-wide patterns
  - Server-specific .gitignore for environment variables and uploaded files
- **Sensitive data protection**: Removed server/.env from Git tracking
- **Build artifacts**: Excluded dist directories, node_modules, etc.

### File Cleanup
- **Removed redundant files**:
  - server/client.ts.backup
  - server/migrations_backup/
  - server/drizzle.config.js (redundant with TypeScript version)
  - gitignore.patched
- **Improved testing**: Added test.env to .gitignore

## Documentation and Testing

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Server verification**: Confirmed server starts and connects to database 
- **Profile API testing**: Verified profile query functionality
- **File upload testing**: Ensured upload-test.html is accessible at http://localhost:3001/upload-test.html

### Documentation
- **Commit documentation**: Created detailed commit message explaining all changes
- **Summary**: Created this comprehensive summary for future reference

## Technical Debt Resolution

### Import Path Corrections
- **Path standardization**: Changed any non-relative import paths to relative
- **Import verification**: Validated import paths in directly referenced files

### Environment Variable Handling
- **Consistent approach**: Established a standardized pattern for loading environment variables
- **Logging removal**: Cleaned up temporary debugging logs for environment variables

## Next Steps

1. **Client-side updates**: Address pending client-related changes in a separate commit
2. **Feature implementation**: Continue with the MVP features outlined in OneShot-MVP-Progress.md
3. **Testing enhancements**: Develop more comprehensive testing approach

This restoration work has established a solid foundation for the OneShot project, addressing the key issues that were preventing proper server operation. The codebase now follows best practices for environment handling, has a clean architecture, and maintains proper separation between code and configuration.
