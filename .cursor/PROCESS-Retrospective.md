## PROCESS-Retrospective.md â€” Post-Task Self-Assessment Template for Claude

This document defines the format Claude must follow at the end of each development task or milestone. It enables Claude to self-assess what was changed, what was verified, and what might be affected.

> Claude: After completing any task, run a retrospective using this structure. Log key changes to system behavior, test memory, and docs.
