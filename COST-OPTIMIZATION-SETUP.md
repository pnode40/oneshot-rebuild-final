## 🎛️ System Configuration

### Model Tiers & Cost Structure

| Tier | Model | Cost/1K Tokens | Use Cases |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Nano** | Claude Haiku | $0.00025 | Formatting, typos, simple edits |
| **Micro** | GPT-3.5 Turbo | $0.0015 | Documentation, basic CRUD |
| **Standard** | Claude Sonnet | $0.003 | Feature development, APIs |
| **Power** | Claude Opus | $0.015 | Architecture, complex logic |
| **Ultra** | Claude Opus | $0.015 | Experimental/fallback |

### Routing Rules

The system automatically routes based on:

1. **Pattern Matching** (Highest Priority)
   - "fix typo" → Nano tier
   - "architect system" → Power tier
   - "implement feature" → Standard tier

2. **File Type Detection**
   - `.json`, `.md`, `.txt` → Nano tier
   - `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js` → Standard tier

3. **Complexity Analysis**
   - Token count estimation
   - Domain detection (architecture, development, etc.)
   - Reasoning requirements

4. **Learning System**
   - Analyzes past performance
   - Optimizes routing decisions
   - Improves quality/cost ratio

## 💰 Cost Savings Examples

### Traditional Approach (Always Use Best Model)
```
Daily tasks: 100
All routed to: Power tier ($0.015/1K tokens)
Average tokens: 2000 per task

Daily cost: 100 × 2 × $0.015 = $3.00
Monthly cost: $90
```

### Smart Routing Approach
```
Daily tasks: 100
- 40% Nano (formatting): 40 × 2 × $0.00025 = $0.02
- 30% Micro (docs): 30 × 2 × $0.0015 = $0.09
- 25% Standard (features): 25 × 2 × $0.003 = $0.15
- 5% Power (architecture): 5 × 2 × $0.015 = $0.15

Daily cost: $0.41
Monthly cost: $12.30
Savings: 86%! 🎉
