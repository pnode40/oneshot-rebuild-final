# Quick Login Guide

## You're Already 90% There!

The app is working! You just need to log in.

### Option 1: Use the UI (Recommended)
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/
2. Click "Sign Up" 
3. Create an account
4. You'll be automatically logged in

### Option 2: Direct Registration URL
Go directly to: http://localhost:5173/register

### Option 3: If you already have an account
Go to: http://localhost:5173/login

### What's Actually Happening
- The app is working perfectly
- You're on a protected page (Create Profile)
- It's asking you to log in first (this is correct!)
- Once you log in, you can create your profile

### Common Issues
- If you see "Network Error": Check the backend is running (look for the other PowerShell window)
- If registration fails: The email might already be used, try a different one

You're literally one login away from success! ðŸŽ‰
