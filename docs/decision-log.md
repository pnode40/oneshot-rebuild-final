## 🧪 TESTING & QA STRATEGY DECISIONS

### Decision #001: Realistic Performance Targets for MVP
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Initial proposal had aggressive targets (<200ms reads, <400ms writes) that would be difficult to achieve for MVP launch.

**Decision**: Progressive performance targets
- MVP: 800ms reads, 1200ms writes
- Month 3-6: 600ms reads, 1000ms writes  
- Month 6-12: 400ms reads, 600ms writes
- Year 2+: 200ms reads, 400ms writes

**Reasoning**: 
- New applications with complex database queries rarely hit 200ms initially
- File upload operations will definitely exceed 400ms
- Better to launch with achievable targets than delay pursuing perfection
- Trust is earned through consistency, not perfection

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep aggressive targets (rejected: unrealistic for MVP)
- No performance targets (rejected: no accountability)
- Static targets (rejected: doesn't allow for improvement)

**Impact**: Enables launch without compromising on quality, provides clear improvement roadmap

**Review Date**: After Month 1 of production data

---

### Decision #002: Progressive Error Budget Strategy
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Initial proposal of <10 exceptions/week was too restrictive for MVP launch phase.

**Decision**: Progressive error budget
- Launch: 25/50/100 (warn/alert/lock)
- Stabilization: 15/25/50
- Mature: 5/10/15

**Reasoning**:
- MVP platforms typically see 50-100+ exceptions initially due to real user behavior
- Learning curve with production vs. test scenarios
- Deployment locks at 15 exceptions would halt development during learning phase
- Progressive improvement shows quality commitment without blocking progress

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Maintain strict 10/week (rejected: would block development)
- No error budget (rejected: no accountability)
- Static higher budget (rejected: no improvement incentive)

**Impact**: Allows for realistic launch phase while maintaining quality improvement trajectory

**Review Date**: Monthly review and adjustment based on actual error patterns

---

### Decision #003: Browser Testing Scope Reduction
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Initial plan included Chrome, Firefox, Safari + mobile browsers for MVP.

**Decision**: Progressive browser testing
- Phase 1: Chrome only (80% of developer users)
- Phase 2: + Firefox
- Phase 3: + Safari/Mobile when user data justifies

**Reasoning**:
- Limited development resources should focus on highest-impact areas
- Chrome dominates developer user base initially
- Can expand based on actual user data rather than assumptions
- Faster MVP launch with focused testing effort

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full browser matrix from start (rejected: resource intensive without data)
- No browser testing (rejected: would miss compatibility issues)
- Mobile-first approach (rejected: desktop users are primary target initially)

**Impact**: Faster testing cycles, focused resource allocation, data-driven expansion

**Review Date**: After Month 2 when user analytics available

---

### Decision #004: AI QA Timeline Realism Adjustment
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Initial timeline suggested Level 3 autonomy by Month 3, which was overly optimistic.

**Decision**: Conservative AI automation timeline
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Manual + AI suggestions
- Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): AI test generation with human approval
- Phase 3 (Months 2-3): Supervised automation (safe changes only)
- Phase 4 (Months 6+): Consider autonomous operations

**Reasoning**:
- Building trust in AI systems requires proven reliability over time
- Complex systems need time to establish patterns for safe automation
- Human oversight crucial during system learning phase
- Better to under-promise and over-deliver on AI capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Aggressive 3-month timeline (rejected: insufficient trust-building time)
- No AI automation (rejected: misses productivity gains)
- Immediate full autonomy (rejected: high risk without validation)

**Impact**: Builds confidence in AI systems gradually, reduces risk of automation failures

**Review Date**: Quarterly assessment of AI automation readiness

---

### Decision #005: Critical Paths Definition Requirement
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Testing strategy mentioned "critical paths" but didn't define what these are for OneShot.

**Decision**: Explicitly defined critical paths with coverage requirements
- Authentication flows: 100% coverage
- Core features (profile, media): 90% coverage
- Specific user journeys documented with error cases

**Reasoning**:
- Cannot achieve meaningful testing without clear definitions
- Different features have different risk/impact levels
- Explicit paths enable focused testing effort
- Error cases often reveal the most critical bugs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Generic "high coverage" goals (rejected: too vague to implement)
- Equal coverage for all features (rejected: inefficient resource allocation)
- Ad-hoc testing approach (rejected: inconsistent quality)

**Impact**: Clear testing targets, focused development effort, measurable quality goals

**Review Date**: Quarterly review as new features are added

---

### Decision #006: Test Data Management Strategy
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Database testing required but no strategy for test data creation and cleanup.

**Decision**: Factory-based test data with automated cleanup
- Test factories: createTestUser(), createTestMedia(), createTestFiles()
- Transaction-based isolation between tests
- Automated file system cleanup hooks
- Realistic test data representative of production

**Reasoning**:
- Consistent test data reduces flaky tests
- Factory pattern enables easy test data creation
- Transaction rollback provides fast, reliable cleanup
- File system cleanup prevents disk space issues in CI

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual test data creation (rejected: inconsistent and time-consuming)
- Shared test database (rejected: tests interfere with each other)
- No cleanup strategy (rejected: resource leaks in CI)

**Impact**: Reliable, fast tests with consistent data, reduced CI costs

**Review Date**: After implementation validation in Week 2

---

### Decision #007: Security Testing Implementation Priority
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Security testing was underspecified in initial strategy.

**Decision**: Comprehensive security testing implementation
- 100% auth flow coverage with specific scenarios
- OWASP Top 10 implementation with concrete tests
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- JWT security and role-based access testing

**Reasoning**:
- Authentication platform requires bulletproof security
- User trust depends on data protection
- Security bugs are hardest to fix after launch
- Automated scanning catches known vulnerabilities early

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic security testing (rejected: insufficient for auth platform)
- Manual security testing only (rejected: doesn't scale)
- Post-launch security audit (rejected: too late for critical issues)

**Impact**: Strong security foundation, reduced vulnerability risk, user trust

**Review Date**: Continuous monitoring with monthly security review

## 🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS

### Decision #008: Hosting Architecture Revision
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Initial plan used Vercel for both frontend and backend, but OneShot has separate Express backend.

**Decision**: Split hosting architecture
- Frontend: Vercel (React + Vite)
- Backend: Railway (Express.js + TypeScript)
- Database: Railway PostgreSQL

**Reasoning**:
- Vercel optimized for frontend, limited for persistent backend services
- Railway provides better Express.js support with integrated PostgreSQL
- Dedicated backend hosting allows better control over WebSocket, file uploads
- Cost-effective for current scale with room to grow

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full Vercel stack (rejected: backend limitations)
- Full AWS/GCP (rejected: over-engineered for MVP)
- Single VPS hosting (rejected: limited scalability)

**Impact**: Better performance, simpler operations, clear scaling path

**Review Date**: After 6 months of production usage

---

### Decision #009: Branch Strategy Correction
**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Context**: Initial branch flow was backwards (main → staging → dev).

**Decision**: Standard Git flow
- dev: Development work and integration
- staging: Integration testing before production
- main: Production deployments (protected)

**Reasoning**:
- Industry standard flow that team members understand
- Changes flow upward toward production, not downward
- Clear promotion path with testing gates
- Protected main branch prevents accidental production changes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep reverse flow (rejected: confusing and non-standard)
- Single main branch (rejected: no testing isolation)
- GitHub Flow (rejected: too simple for staged deployments)

**Impact**: Clear development workflow, reduced deployment errors, team alignment

**Review Date**: After initial development cycles prove effectiveness
