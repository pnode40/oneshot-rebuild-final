## üö® ERROR BUDGET & MONITORING

### Progressive Error Budget
```yaml
Launch Phase (Months 1-2):
  Warning Threshold: 25 exceptions/week
  Alert Threshold: 50 exceptions/week
  Deploy Lock: 100 exceptions/week

Stabilization Phase (Months 3-6):
  Warning Threshold: 15 exceptions/week
  Alert Threshold: 25 exceptions/week
  Deploy Lock: 50 exceptions/week

Mature Platform (6+ months):
  Warning Threshold: 5 exceptions/week
  Alert Threshold: 10 exceptions/week
  Deploy Lock: 15 exceptions/week
```

### Production Monitoring
```yaml
Error Tracking:
  Platform: Sentry
  Alerts: Eric notification for auth errors (immediate)
  Reporting: Daily digest for non-critical errors

Performance Monitoring:
  Response Times: Average + p95 tracking
  Database: Connection pool + slow query monitoring
  Memory: Server memory usage + leak detection
  Uptime: Health check endpoints with external monitoring

User Impact Tracking:
  Feature Success Rates: % of successful auth, uploads, profile updates
  Error Impact: Which errors affect user journeys most
  Performance Impact: How response time affects user behavior
```

## üîê SECURITY TESTING IMPLEMENTATION

### Authentication Security Tests
```yaml
JWT Security:
  - Token expiration handling
  - Invalid token rejection
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - Secret key security

Role-Based Access Control:

  - Users cannot access other user's data
  - Proper authorization headers required
  - Role escalation prevention

Session Management:
  - Secure cookie settings
  - Session hijacking prevention
  - Concurrent session handling
  - Logout token invalidation
```

### OWASP Top 10 Implementation
```yaml
A01 - Broken Access Control:
  Tests: User isolation, role boundaries, direct object references
  
A02 - Cryptographic Failures:
  Tests: Password hashing (bcrypt), JWT secret security, HTTPS enforcement
  
A03 - Injection:
  Tests: SQL injection prevention (Drizzle parameterized queries)
  
A05 - Security Misconfiguration:
  Tests: Default credentials, error message exposure, security headers
  
A07 - Identification/Authentication Failures:
  Tests: Brute force protection, weak password prevention, MFA readiness
```
