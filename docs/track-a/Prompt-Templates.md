# ðŸ§  OneShot Prompt Templates for Documentation Enforcement

Version: A-2025-05-27-001

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To ensure all AI-generated documentation is **complete**, **context-aware**, and **standards-compliant** by enforcing prompt templates for Claude 4 during markdown creation or updates.

These prompts must:
- Validate existing `.md` file content before overwriting
- Reference project-specific context loaded from `.md` files
- Follow structural formatting (headings, frontmatter, versioning)
- Include verification checklist items in output
- Use embedded tags for traceability (e.g., `#sprint-a`, `#component-profile-editor`)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Prompt Template: New Documentation File
```
You are Claude 4. Generate a markdown (.md) file with complete, context-aware documentation.

Context:
- This is for the OneShot recruiting platform.
- Documentation lives in `docs/track-a/`
- All long-term context is loaded from `.md` files like `MVP-Progress.md`, `Roles-and-Responsibilities.md`, etc.

Requirements:
1. Do **not** leave any section blank or marked as TODO
2. Include a version tag at the top: `Version: A-YYYY-MM-DD-###`
3. Include context tags at bottom (e.g., `#ai-system #auth-flow`)
4. Format with clear headings (##, ###)
5. Include a manual verification checklist at the end

File Name: `{{fileName}}`
Purpose: `{{purpose}}`

Generate the full file content now.

## ðŸ“‹ Prompt Template: Update Existing Markdown
```

4. Retain version history and embedded context tags
5. Never delete verification checklists or remove version locking
