# ðŸ“˜ OneShot AI Dev Documentation Safety & Quality Assurance System

Version: A-2025-05-27-001

## âœ… Objective
Establish a **zero-tolerance system for documentation loss, incompleteness, or drift** across the OneShot AI-driven development lifecycle. This ensures:
- Long-term **project continuity**
- Alignment between **code and documentation**
- Full context preservation between AI agents and human collaborators

## ðŸ§© Core Components

### 1. **AI Prompt Enforcement**
- Claude 4 receives **standardized prompt templates** that:
  - Enforce complete, up-to-date, and context-aware `.md` generation
  - Require existing doc validation before overwrite

### 2. **Git Pre-Commit Hooks**
- Block commits with:
  - Empty or undersized `.md` files
  - Syntax errors or invalid frontmatter
  - (Optional) AI-based semantic checks for shallow or incomplete docs

### 3. **CI Validation Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions run:
  - Markdown linting (headings, structure, link syntax)
  - Spelling & grammar checks
  - Format & consistency checks
  - Documentation **coverage reporting**

### 4. **Documentation Coverage & Regression Reports**
- Generate weekly reports showing:
  - What's missing (e.g., empty `.md`, drifted content)
  - What regressed (e.g., removed docs, misaligned versions)

### 5. **Version Locking & Alignment**
- Markdown includes version headers
- Lock doc versions to corresponding Git tags or sprint IDs
- Enforce alignment between code and docs at commit or PR merge

### 6. **Review Workflows & Sign-Off**
- All PRs involving docs require:
  - AI-generated review summary
  - Manual sign-off from Eric or designated reviewer

### 7. **AI-Assisted Markdown Merging**
- Claude reviews conflicting `.md` changes
- Offers merge options with explanations
- Prioritizes content preservation, avoids overwrite

### 8. **Alerts & Notification System**
- Triggers:
  - Empty doc committed
  - Missing doc in coverage scan
  - Mismatch between code and doc versions
- Sends alerts to Slack/email/Notion inbox

### 9. **Rich Linking & Anchoring**
- `.md` files include:
  - Code snippet references
  - Embedded diagrams/screenshots
  - Context tags (e.g., `#profile-flow`, `#ai-handshake`)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Plan of Action
1. **Create and save this file** as:
   ```
   docs/track-a/OneShot-Doc-Safety-Plan.md
   ```
2. Begin work on:
   - `Prompt-Templates.md` for AI doc generation
   - `PreCommit-Hooks.md` to define Git guards
   - `CI-Workflow-Docs.yml` GitHub Actions file (draft)
3. Create `Session-Logs.md` entry to track this planning
4. Present Claude with the prompt template draft next session

### Guardrails
- **No new features ship** until this system is verified
- **All doc-related commits** must pass enforcement checks
