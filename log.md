# Development Log: Migration System

## History

### Initial Setup (Before Current Work)
- Implemented initial database schema with Drizzle ORM
- Created first migrations: `0000_red_karma.sql` and `0001_abnormal_yellowjacket.sql`
- Manually applied these migrations to the database
- Added JWT authentication and profile management features
- Created test migration: `0002_test_migration.sql`

### Issue Discovery and Initial Troubleshooting
- Encountered "No file migrations/undefined.sql found" error when using standard Drizzle migrate
- Implemented workaround hybrid migration script
- Tried various approaches to fix the issue including:
  - Updating Drizzle ORM version
  - Rebuilding the migration tracking table
  - Fixing duplicate entries in the tracking table

## Recent Changes

### 2024-05-05: Comprehensive Investigation
- Updated Drizzle ORM to version 0.43.1
- Implemented enhanced diagnostics in migration script
- Created `query-migration-table.ts` to analyze database state
- Created `fix-migration-types.ts` to attempt fixing type mismatches
- Identified root cause: type mismatch between BIGINT column and string values

### 2024-05-06: Solution Design and Planning
- Conducted risk assessment of different solutions
- Designed comprehensive migration system rebuild strategy
- Created detailed implementation plan with phases
- Prepared project management documents for tracking progress
- Designed rebuild-migration-state.ts script (pending implementation)

## Next Steps (Planned)

### 2024-05-07: Migration System Rebuild
- Implement rebuild-migration-state.ts script
- Test rebuilt system with existing migrations
- Create validation tool for migration state
- Update documentation for new approach

### 2024-05-08: Enhanced Testing
- Implement comprehensive test suite
- Add automatic rollback capabilities
- Create cross-environment validation

## Key Insights and Decisions

1. **Root Cause Identification**: The core issue is a type mismatch between how PostgreSQL defines the column (BIGINT) and how the values are stored (strings). This confuses Drizzle ORM's migrator.

2. **Solution Approach**: A complete rebuild of the migration tracking table with proper types is necessary, as attempts to fix just the types have not resolved the core issue.

3. **Long-term Strategy**: After fixing the immediate issue, we'll implement enhanced testing, reliability features, and developer experience improvements to ensure the system remains stable.

4. **Community Contribution**: We'll work on contributing a fix back to the Drizzle ORM project to help others who might encounter similar issues.
